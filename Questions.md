# Questions

## About poultry farms

- What roles do people play on the farm?
  - Owner
  - Worker
  - Vet?
  - Inspector?
- How closely does each role work with the flocks?
  - How much time on a typical day would each role spend in close proximity with the flock?
- What type of poultry flocks are there?
  - broiler
  - laying
  - incubator
  - What are the differences in how these flocks are handled?
    - I assume layers have their eggs collected regularly.
    - Removal of fecal matter?
    - Feeding?
    - Inspections?
    - Differences in housing conditions?
      - Are incubators more/less isolated from the environment than broilers?
      - Backyard flocks vs Commercial?
      - Free-run, Free-range?
- Do farms have multiple types of flocks?
  - If so, do they come into contact with each other?
- How many incubators does the typical farm work with?
  - Is each poultry flock replaced entirely? Or is there mixing of old and new stock?
  - Do farms consistently work with the same incubators?
- How frequently are flocks sent to the abattoir?
  - Is the whole flock sent at once?
  - Is the same abattoir always used?
- What happens if a farmer suspects their flock is infected?
- How frequently do outside parties visit the farm?
  - Inspectors?
  - Vets?
  - Buyers/Sellers?
  - Nosey scientists trying to learn about poultry farming?

## About H5N1

- For each species (currently human and poultry flocks),
and pathogen (currently H5N1), we need estimates of the following:
  - Time from exposure to infectious
  - Time from infectious to symptomatic
  - Probability of being symptomatic
- For poultry:
  - How does the disease progress in a poultry flock?
    - i.e. what is the best way to model the progression considering:
      - Time from first exposure to infectious
        - Ward suggests this is ~4 days in humans
      - Duration of infectious period
      - Probability of an infection going undetected (time dependent?)
  - What are the first signs of infection a farmer might notice?
- For humans:
  - Time from symptomatic to critical
    - Lai suggests this is ~4 days
    - Hui suggests ~4 days from onset of symptoms to hospitalization
  - Probability of critical symptoms
    - Lai suggests 90% of cases will eventually be hospitalized
  - Time from asymptomatic to recovered
  - Time from mild to recovered
  - Time from Critical to recovered
    - Lai suggests ~5 days
  - Time from critical to death
    - Lai suggests ~5 days
- Are there any vaccines available for each species type?
  - If so, what is there efficacy?
- Other types of immunity (e.g. from previous infection)
- Immunity progression
  - What is the peak immunity achieved
  - When is peak immunity achieved
  - What is the final level of immunity achieved?
  - When is the final level of immunity achieved?
- Cross-species infection
  - probability of poultry infecting human
  - probability of human infecting poultry

## About Quebec

- How many poultry farms are there in Quebec?
  - Martine suggested 700+ Broiler flocks, 200 laying flocks, and 99 incubator flocks.
- How many abattoirs are in Quebec?

## General questions

- What do we include in the model and what can be excluded?
- Whats the best way to model immunity (e.g. should we use the nab framework?)
