# Zoonosim

A descendant of Covasim and Pathosim aimed at studying zoonotic diseases.

The most significant change from previous versions is that the "people" object has now become the "agents" object. sim.agents has (currently) 4 subobjects, "human", "flock", "barn", and "water", these each track the state of a specific type of agent.

In terms of operating the software, the most important component is the "pars" object. sim.pars details all (most) of the specific values that get used throughout the simulation. The default values of parameters are defined in parameters.py and defaults.py. parameter values can be changed using sim.update_pars.

## Model Parameters

- agent_types
  - An array of strings
  - Each string corresponds to a different type of agent
- n_farms
  - The total number of farms in the simulation.
  - This value only gets used when generating the population, it is not referenced during actual simulations.
- pop_size
  - The total number of agents (of all types) in the simulation.
  - This value is typically set automatically when the population is generated
- pop_size_by_type
  - A dictionary, the keys are the agent types and the values are number of agents of that specific type
  - Typically set automatically when the population is created
- pop_scale
  - vestigial parameter left over from the dynamic rescaling functionality present in parent versions of the software
  - in principle the value shouldn't matter but we set it to 1.0 out of an abundance of caution
- rescale
  - vestigial parameter left over from the dynamic rescaling functionality present in parent versions of the software
  - Some of the older parts of code expect this to exist but it must be set to False since dynamic rescaling is not supported
- initial_conditions
  - A dictionary, the keys are the agent types and the values are the number of initial infections among that type of agent
- start_day
  - initial day of the simulation
  - in the form yyyy-mm-dd

  - when set to None, n_days gets used instead
- n_days
  - the number of days the simulation should run for
  - used if end_day is None
- rand_seed
  - setting this will reset the seed to this value before any RNG operations. This allows for reproducible simulations
